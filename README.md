# Expres-Rotam
All ELEMENTS MUST BE IN THE SAME FILE OR THE CODE WILL BROKE.

     EXPRES ROTAM, brought to life with Vibecoding, is an intelligent Python tool that filters out time-wasting stops on bus journeys, offering you the fastest "express" route. Using multi-bot technology, it scans data in real-time, removes unwanted cities from the list, and provides direct ticketing capabilities. Smart, fast, in your control!
This is a fun project of mine that i did in 3 days with an hatred towards bus trips that said it wont visit to an bus stop and it does. Ive done all this with Gemini. It was really fun until Gemini started to forgot my prompts and I didnt want to deal with it some more.
Its designed for Turkey bus trips and it scrapes the data from Obilet.
